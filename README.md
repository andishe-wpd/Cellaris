Advanced Usage
--------------

### Pattern Creation

```
const customPattern = new Cellaris.Pattern({
  name: 'Custom Glider',
  matrix: [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
  ],
  rules: {
    survive: [2, 3],
    birth: [3]
  }
});

```

### Performance Optimization Tips

-   Use appropriate cell sizes for your simulation scale
-   Enable WebGL acceleration for large grids
-   Implement boundary optimizations for infinite grids
-   Use worker threads for complex rule calculations

### Keyboard Shortcuts

-   Space: Play/Pause
-   R: Reset
-   S: Save state
-   L: Load state
-   +/-: Zoom in/out
-   Arrow keys: Pan view
